This should be an inspectably impact-free change, at the cost of readability;
that is, a reviewer should be able to tell easiliy from each commit that, when
cca_in_ad is false, the behavior does not change.

When the cca_in_ad setting is true:

* AD sends CCA configs for containers without other LogsConfig
    * [DONE] AD no longer sends service configs (FIXME's)
    * [WIP] AD sends CCA configs -- need to figure out what these look like

* Logs-Agent doesn't handle services anymore
    * [DONE] AD logs scheduler does not send services
    * [DONE] CCA scheduler disabled
    * [DONE] k8s launcher disabled
    * [DONE] Docker launcher only pairs sources with services if feature flag is false

* Logs-Agent handles CCA configs
    * always handled by the (new) container launcher, creating child sources with
      Config.Type=FileType when necessary.
    * set source, service correctly
        * [WIP] let's put this byzantine logic in a new module
    * Container launcher recognizes kcur, dcur, force_dcur, path accessibility,
      LogWhat, and registry in deciding whether to log a container from socket or file
        * [WIP] let's put this byzantine logic in a new module
    * some of this stuff is in dustin.mitchell/ac-1644-backup

QA:
 - docker socket inaccessible
 - docker daemon killed during logging
 - docker daemon stopped during logging, later restarted
 - various container files inaccessible

TODO: (search // TODO in code for authoritative list)
 - error channel for socket tailers
 - how does shutdown work (sources removed?)
 - source/service/name for various modes
 - various directories for various file modes

Minor Bits:
 - doc, test pointer-equality of added and removed sources
 - move tailerfactory to /internal/?
 - doc for AD, logs scheduler whether configs are unscheduled / sources are removed on stop
